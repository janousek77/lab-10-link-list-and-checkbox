## Description
401 JS -- lab 09 persistent storage

Took my lab 8 stuff and copied it over. Changed everything the to the same format as demo code. Got my put tests to pass. Most everything else fails. Got a few of the bad paths to pass. Stuck at 5 passing and 5 failing. After some help from the TAs I got my get tests to pass and after some more guidance finally got delete to work too. Everything passes.
